# 66 Days Of Data - Log

### Day 1: September 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Created 66-days-of-data repo to track progress on this challenge.
- Used Git to clone the remote repo down to my local repo. Pushing changes back to GitHub through Git as well.
- Continuing Chapter 4 of "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python", which is focused on lists.
  - Working with lists:
    - Created a variable and assigned it as an empty list []
    - Followed that with a while loop that breaks out of the loop of an empty string is entered
    - Otherwise it continues iterating and allows for more inputs which gets outputted in a for loop
    - File name 'allMyCats2_ch4.py' in the auto-boring-stuff.git repo

**Thoughts:**
I took quite a long break from my last round of #66daysofdata. I'm riding this wave of motivation to reestablish this as a habit. My primary goal for this round is to increase my skills with Python.

### Day 2: September 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Updated my GitHub overview page with an About Me: README.md file. I used a generator to get the template, but will continue to alter it as needed.
- Still continuing with lists from "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python"
  - Reviewed list methods like append() and insert()
  - Also learned about the enumerate function
- ** putting a place holder here because I will resume studies after the gym :D
- Got back from the gym and continued more through my review of lists
  - practiced list methods such as remove(), sort(), passed keyword arguments within these methods like sort(reverse=True), to sort in descending order.
  - Went over sequence data types: lists, strings, range objects returned by the range() function and tuples are considered sequence data types. Meaning they can be indexed, sliced, and used in for loops with len() or with in and not in operators.


**Thoughts:**
I'm feeling impatient and want to get through these chapters that are of review for me and to the later chapters dealing with actual Python automation.

But I little by little, there are additional things that I'm picking up that I either forgot, or never learned during my initial pass at learning Python.

This is a marathon not a sprint, so I will continue to take it slower but with consistency.

Thoughts after the gym: I think I like this routine.
- Finish work
- Have dinner
- Study for a bit, digesting food, and record #66daysofdata challenge
- Go to gym
- Continue studying until tired
We'll see if I can keep this up
