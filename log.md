# 66 Days Of Data - Log

### Day 1: September 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Created 66-days-of-data repo to track progress on this challenge.
- Used Git to clone the remote repo down to my local repo. Pushing changes back to GitHub through Git as well.
- Continuing Chapter 4 of "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python", which is focused on lists.
  - Created a variable and assigned it as an empty list []
  - Followed that with a while loop that breaks out of the loop of an empty string is entered
  - Otherwise it continues iterating and allows for more inputs which gets outputted in a for loop
  - File name 'allMyCats2.py' in the auto-boring-stuff.git repo

**Thoughts:**
I took quite a long break from my last round of #66daysofdata. I'm riding this wave of motivation to reestablish this as a habit. My primary goal for this round is to increase my skills with Python.
